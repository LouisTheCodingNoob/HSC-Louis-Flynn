			<li>I partnered with Redesigned Retail to embark on a two year project to build a website designed to allow suppliers to monitor and enforce Amazon pricing among their retailers. As the sole developer, I built the entire site from the ground up, including setting up the full end-to-end cloud architecture. The result was a robust, scalable solution that met the client’s needs and exceeded their expectations.</li>

			<li>"Matt delivered an exceptional product that exceeded our expectations. His ability to bridge the gap between stakeholders like myself and the complexities of technology is truly unparalleled." - Kyle H., Owner of Redesigned Retail and MapAuthority</li>

			<li>I was a developer for over two years on the 'Quick Track' team, which focused on delivering projects that required 30 days or less of effort. Being part of this team was a unique and invaluable experience, as it allowed me to work on a diverse range of projects, each demanding creative problem-solving and technical expertise. I gained exposure to a variety of business domains, including fixing critical bugs, enhancing tools to better manage member stores, processing order information for forecasting purposes, generating financial reports, and developing logistics solutions to optimize supply chain operations.</li>

			<li>"Very few people nowadays can be assigned a six-month project that contains only a couple of high-level details, proactively engage the necessary stakeholders to build a comprehensive requirements list, and successfully deliver the project with minimal assistance from management. Matt is one of those rare individuals." – Karla W., Enhancement Team Manager at Do it Best</li>

		<dt>Do it Best - Rebate Team</dt>
		<dd>The Rebate Team was one of the largest and most collaborative development teams at Do it Best, consisting of eight developers (myself included), a UI/UX engineer, a business analyst, and finance stakeholders. Over the course of six months, we worked closely with the finance team to design and develop a robust application for calculating and managing member store rebates.

		The application was successfully delivered on time and within budget, meeting all stakeholder expectations. Additionally, the Rebate Team was recognized for its exceptional collaboration and performance, earning the highest developer satisfaction rating among all teams at Do it Best. This experience not only showcased my ability to work effectively within a large, cross-functional team but also reinforced the importance of aligning technical solutions with business needs to drive impactful results.

		<dt>Southwest Allen County Fire District</dt>
		<dd>The Southwest Allen County Fire District faced challenges with three outdated workstations that were critical for accounting and fire station management tasks. My company was hired to research and recommend new business-grade laptops that would meet their operational needs while staying within budget. After finalizing the recommendations, I traveled on-site to set up and configure the new workstations, ensuring a seamless transition with minimal disruption to their daily operations. The result was a significant boost in productivity for the fire station, as the new systems allowed staff to work more efficiently and reliably. Additionally, the project was completed 50% under the original budget.
